This interface is used to encapsulate all relevant information produced during the optimization process that can be utilized by the SelectExecutor for efficient query execution.
 * @interface SelectOptimizationResult
 * @property {ExpressionNode[]} cascadedSelections - An array of selection expressions that have been cascaded from the original WHERE clause, representing the individual conditions extracted from the original logical expression.
 * @property {ExpressionNode[]} orderedSelections - An array of selection expressions that have been ordered based on their complexity and the number of referenced tables, which helps determine the optimal order of evaluation during execution.
 * @property {Record<string, ExpressionNode[]>} pushedSelectionsByTable - An object mapping table names to arrays of selection expressions that have been pushed down to be evaluated at the level of the respective table, allowing for more efficient filtering during data retrieval.
 * @property {ExpressionNode[]} residualSelections - An array of selection expressions that could not be pushed down to specific tables and must be evaluated at a higher level during execution, typically after joins are performed.
 * @property {Record<string, string[]>} projectionByTable - An object mapping table names to arrays of column names that need to be projected (selected) from each table, which is determined based on the columns referenced in the SELECT clause and any selections that were pushed down.
 * @property {JoinNode[]} introducedJoins - An array of JOIN nodes that were introduced during optimization to replace selection conditions that reference multiple tables, allowing those conditions to be evaluated as part of the join operation rather than as residual selections.
 * @property {FromNode[]} optimizedFrom - An array of FROM clause nodes that represent the optimized structure of the FROM clause after introducing joins and potentially reordering tables.
 * @property {ExpressionNode} [optimizedWhere] - An optional expression node representing the optimized WHERE clause, which is composed of any residual selections that could not be pushed down or transformed into joins, combined into a single logical expression if necessary.
